# ILLUSTREMOR
## Description
Our mission with ILLUSTREMOR is provide and share relevant earthquake information to all U.S citizens in order to reduce or prevent injuries, deaths, and damages to property from earthquakes. This web app will hopefully make users understand earthquakes and increase their awareness of the potential effects. Users will also be able to see through the map which regions are the most active and most likely to face an earthquake with respect to their location. Lastly, ILLUSTREMOR serves as a monitoring application as users can report an earthquake into our ever-growing database.
